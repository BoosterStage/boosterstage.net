Booster Stage is looking for a full-stack developer who has a little experience and a lot of aptitude for web development. The ideal candidate is a quick learner and is teachable. 

### Requirements
- Great communication, especially written English.
- 1+ years of professional software development experience.
- OR recent completion of programming bootcamp.

Even though you may not yet be senior-level at writing Ruby or Javascript code, you should be able to read and understand Ruby code and find your way around a Rails project. You must be proficient at HTML and CSS, and have a pretty good understanding of how the web works. You will be expected to create Ruby and Javascript code right off the bat. 

We LOVE working with startups. To be honest, we think it would be a drag to work on the same project year after year. That’s why this job is so fun: we get to help startups develop the very first version of their products. That means our work is always fresh and new. Most of the time we’re starting with a blank slate, which is an extremely fun way to work. Our “Launchpad” projects usually start out relatively uniform and easy, and get progressively more complex and challenging as we add features. 

### About the Job

You’ll be helping us build apps for our clients, most of which are startups. Most of the time we’re building the first version of their product. Projects start out as a basic Ruby on Rails web app, and grow in complexity as we add features. 

This is a full-time contract, with the expectation that if we like working together you’ll join our company as a full-time employee (unless you’re not a US citizen, in which case you can stay on as a contractor - it really doesn’t make much difference). 

**This job is 100% remote.** That means you have ultimate flexibility over your own working schedule and your working environment. 

**We don’t bill hours**, and we don’t track hours. You won’t have anyone looking over your shoulder micromanaging your time. By the same token, we do expect a high degree of productivity and self-discipline, and we expect you to consistently deliver high-quality work. 

**This is not a 9-5 job** (though it could be if those are your favorite hours). We rarely work over 40 hours in a week, barring those rare moments of crunch times when we’re trying to hit a deadline or the server room is on fire. 

**We promote a distraction-free work environment.** Our work style is modeled after 37signals successful approach to productive remote work. We even use Basecamp as our primary communication tool. 

**We write.** Because we don’t have the opportunity to chat over the water cooler, we write A LOT to keep each other in the loop. Basecamp is our water cooler, and we use the message board, campfire, and check-ins extensively to keep each other up to date on what we’re working on. 

You’ll also be expected to write for our company blog. Four to six articles per year should just about do it, although we wouldn’t stop you from writing more frequently. Topics include MVP issues, product design, UI/UX, startup launch stories, and best/worst practices for startups. Writing for your personal blog is also A-OK. 

**We consistently deliver high-quality work.** All our products are rigorously tested before we deliver them to our clients. You’ll be required to help maintain our test suite and write new tests as you work on features. The full test suite must pass before you merge in your code. 

**We sometimes work together.** Through the magic of the Internet, we sometimes will videoconference via Zoom, or we might pair program for a while to work out a difficult problem. 

**Learning on the Job**. We love learning and are never content with what we already know. As a company, we devote time and resources to learning and expanding our knowledge library. Openness to learning new things is essential. You’ll be expected and encouraged to build your skills and add to your personal toolbox. We’re particularly looking for self-directed learning, but we may also want you to pursue some particular thread of knowledge for a particular project. Skills you might find yourself building on the job: 

- Advanced Javascript including React or Vue.js
- Graphic design
- Lean or Agile project management
- Mobile development

#### Skills you’ll need every day
- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript
- HTML & CSS
- Git

#### Bonus points for experience in:
- Graphic design
- User interface design
- Lean startup
- Test-driven development
- Front-end Javascript frameworks

Even though this position doesn't require a ton of experience, we are looking for certain qualities that will make for a great developer: 

- Self-motivated
- Disciplined
- Curious
- Teachable

We’re a tiny family-owned business. Literally a mom and pop shop. Ryan and Bethany, the owners, have been building stuff for the web since 2004, and we’ve gotten really good at building new products for startups. Over the years we've created numerous websites and products for the web.

We blog on the [Booster Stage website](https://boosterstage.net/articles), and
we sometimes tweet what we're reading at
