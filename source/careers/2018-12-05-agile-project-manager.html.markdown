The product designer is a liaison between the client and our development team. The product designer works directly with both clients and our developers to create great products. 

In a very real way, you’ll become part of our clients’ team. They should come to believe that you deeply understand their problem and the solution, and that you actually are on their team, building their product. 

As **Agile Project Manager and Product Success Advocate** you will:

* Communicate with clients regularly to understand the problem, solution, and product.
* Create detailed Statements of Work based on client requirements.
* Translate SoWs into actionable tasks for the development team. 
* Sometimes create wireframe diagrams to guide developers. 
* Create Github issues for each feature that will be built.
* Communicate daily with developers to translate requirements and review work. 

A typical development cycle is six weeks long, broken up into two-week sprints. Programming experience is not necessary, but the product designer must have a basic understanding of our development cycle in order to craft the scope of each sprint in a realistic way. Over promising to the client will result in harried developers and unhappy clients. 

Though you won’t be writing code, you should be able to check out the codebase, get it running on your local development environment, and review code commits. Thus, a development background is helpful, though not absolutely necessary. 

You must be able to read and understand technical and API documentation, and translate this to technical requirements meant for our team. You must be able to write clear and concise specifications that are detailed enough to provide developers with actionable tasks, but readable enough to be understood by a normal human. 

The ability to think and act on multiple projects simultaneously is crucial. Most of the time you’ll be managing 2-3 projects at once, each with a dedicated developer. 

### Requirements

* Native English speaker
* Able to work in US business hours every day
* Friendly, amiable, easy to talk to
* Astonishing listening skills
* UI/UX design experience 
* Agile project management experience

### Helpful skills

* Ability to set up and run a Ruby on Rails project in your local development environment.
* Ability to use Git, checkout source code, review commits, and comment on commits.
* Basic understanding of HTML & CSS. 
* Understanding of relational databases and their conventions and requirements. 
* Experience with payment platforms and credit card processing. 


### How we work

**You’ll be helping us build web apps for our clients**, most of which are startups. Most of the time we’re building the first version of their product. Sometimes we’re redesigning an existing product.

**You don’t need to be a coder**, but you do need to be comfortable with code. You’ll certainly spend a lot of time in Sketch or Photoshop, but you’ll also be putting together CSS and HTML in the live web application environment.

**This job is 100% remote**. Though you’re welcome to come in to work in our Elgin, TX office (near Austin), you’ll have ultimate flexibility over your own working schedule and environment.

**This is not a 9-5 job** (though it could be if those are your favorite hours). We rarely work over 40 hours per week, baring those rare moments of crunch time when we’re trying to hit a deadline or the server room is on fire.

**We promote a distraction-free work environment**. Our work style is modeled after 37signals’ successful approach to productive remote work. We even use Basecamp as our primary communication tool.

**We write**. Because we don’t have the opportunity to chat over the water cooler, we write A LOT to keep each other in the loop. Basecamp is our water cooler, and we use the message board, Campfire, and check-ins extensively to keep each other up to date on what were working on.

**You’ll also be encouraged to write for our company blog**. Three to six articles per year should just about do it, although we wouldn’t stop you from writing more frequently. Topics include MVP issues, product design, UI/UX, startup launch stories, and best/worst practices for startups. Writing for your personal blog is also A-OK.

**We consistently deliver high-quality work**. All our products are rigorously tested before we deliver them to our clients. You’ll be required to help maintain our test suite and write new tests as you work on features. The full test suite must pass before you merge in your code.

**We sometimes work together**. Through the magic of the Internet, we sometimes will video conference via Zoom, or we might pair program for a while to work out a difficult problem. If you happen to live near Austin, Texas, then we might even get to work together in person sometimes.

**We learn on the job**. We love learning and are never content with what we already know. As a company, we devote time and resources to learning and expanding our knowledge library. Openness to learning new things is essential. You’ll be expected and encouraged to build your skills and add to your personal toolbox. We encourage self-directed learning, but we may also want you to pursue some particular thread of knowledge for a particular project.

### About Booster Stage

We build new products for the web.

Most of our work involves creating brand-new web apps for startups who are launching their MVP. Though we have also worked for big organizations who act like startups.

We’re a tiny family-owned business. Literally a mom and pop shop. Ryan and Bethany, the owners, have been building stuff for the web since 2004, and we’ve gotten really good at building new products for startups. Over the years we've created numerous websites and products for the web.

We blog on the [Booster Stage website](https://boosterstage.net/articles), and
we sometimes tweet what we're reading at
[@Booster_Stage](https://twitter.com/Booster_Stage). And when we're feeling
grown up we also hang out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/1292733/).
