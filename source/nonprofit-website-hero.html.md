Your organization's website is the most important, **and the most frustrating** part of your organization's public presence.

You know you need to keep it up to date. How else will you attract new donors, inform constituents about your services, and keep members up to date about your organization's happenings?

Keeping your website up-to-date and looking professional is essential to maintaining your online fundraising. Donors who have confidence in your brand will donate more and tell their friends.

### But managing and maintaining a website is a daunting and technical task.

Like a garden, websites require care and maintenance. They can become out of date quickly. Software need to be upgraded, databases need to be backed up, comments need to be moderated, images need to be uploaded and optimized, and content needs to be edited and proofread.

All this takes more time and resources than most organizations have.

Do you know who to call if your website needs attention? What if the person who set up the website is no longer with your organization? What if you can’t get in touch with the volunteers who helped set it up? What if they don’t have time?

Are you happy with your website online giving form? If so, you’re in the minority. Studies have shown that giving to nonprofits is harder than buying products on e-commerce sites ([Nielsen-Norman Group: “It's harder to give money away than it is to spend money buying stuff”](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/non-profit-websites-donations/)). Badly designed online giving forms are hard to use and can lose you money.

### You need to have a professional who can help you maintain a high-quality web presence at all times.

Think that’s out of reach?

It’s not.

Your organization’s web presence is worth investing in because it is so important. But it doesn’t have to be a huge investment.

Unless your organization is very large, you probably don’t need to have a dedicated IT staff. So why pay for one?

# FAQ

### What if we use more hours?

You can use up to twice your allocated hours at no charge. For example, if you're on the Hero plan (2 hours), and you need us for four hours that month, then there's no extra charge for that. If you still need more than that, then we'll charge you at our hourly rate of $125. If you regularly need more than your allocated hours, then we'll ask you to upgrade or work out a custom pricing arrangement.

### Can you redesign our website or build us a whole new website?

Yes! That's not exactly maintenance though, so we'll work with you as a separate project.

### How much does a new website cost?

New websites and redesigns start at $2500.
