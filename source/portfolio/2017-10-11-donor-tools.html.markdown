Donor Tools is smart, online donor management software for nonprofit organizations. We built Donor Tools because we werenâ€™t happy with the software that was available for nonprofits to track and manage their donations.

Donor Tools is built using Ruby on Rails, with PostgreSQL serving the database, and is hosted on Engineyard.
