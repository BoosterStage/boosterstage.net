When I moved my blog over to Medium one of the things I really missed was the ability to bring my lead magnets. It’s so nice to be able to offer someone a downloadable item in exchange for their email address — it’s a great way to grow your email list, and it’s nice to connect readers with your valuable resources. Too bad there was no way to embed lead magnets in Medium posts.

So, like all good developers, I decided to solve that problem.

## Introducing ContentUpgrade.me

Now you can embed your lead magnets in Medium posts just like any other media — simply by pasting a URL.

So this: `https://contentupgrade.me/kKpZyJjG`...

Gets turned into this:

<div style="width: 100%; position: relative;">
  <iframe scrolling="no" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="0" border="no" src="https://contentupgrade.me/kKpZyJjG.html?ref="></iframe>
</div>

... automatically!

We’ve only been live a few weeks but we’ve already seen some encouraging increases in our own opt-in rates.

The coolest thing about ContentUpgrade.me is that it also [works with WordPress](https://contentupgrade.me/help/wordpress). So if you republish your content you can take your lead magnets with you.

## It's Free

Your first lead magnet is completely free forever, so there’s no reason not to try it, use it, and love it. Just like puppies, but without the commitment!

Head over to [ContentUpgrade.me](https://contentupgrade.me?ref=mysmallidea.com) and create your first Medium.com lead magnet. I’d love to know what you think.
