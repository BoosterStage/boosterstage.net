Launching software is hard. At Booster Stage, we’re on a mission to help businesses launch extraordinary software products. We believe market validation, agile methodology, and iterative development are keys to launching successful web-based products.

We have an immediate opening for a Ruby on Rails developer to help us build cutting-edge, fully-tested, agile web applications for our clients.

### How We Work

**You’ll be helping us build apps for our clients**, most of which are startups. Most of the time we’re building the first version of their product. Projects start out as a basic Ruby on Rails web app, and grow in complexity as we add features.

**This is a full-time contract**, with the expectation that if we like working together you’ll join our company as a full-time employee (unless you’re not a US citizen, in which case you can stay on as a contractor - it really doesn’t make much difference).

**Part-time is an option.** Interested in a part-time/freelance option? That could work also.

**This job is 100% remote.** That means you have ultimate flexibility over your own working schedule and your working environment.

**This is not a 9-5 job** (though it could be if those are your favorite hours). We rarely work over 40 hours per week, barring those rare moments of crunch times when we’re trying to hit a deadline or the server room is on fire.

**We promote a distraction-free work environment**. Our work style is modeled after 37signals successful approach to productive remote work. We even use Basecamp as our primary communication tool.

**We write.** Because we don’t have the opportunity to chat over the water cooler, we write A LOT to keep each other in the loop. Basecamp is our water cooler, and we use the message board, campfire, and check-ins extensively to keep each other up to date on what we’re working on.

**You’ll also be encouraged to write for our company blog.** Three to six articles per year should just about do it, although we wouldn’t stop you from writing more frequently. Topics include MVP issues, product design, UI/UX, startup launch stories, and best/worst practices for startups. Writing for your personal blog is also A-OK.

**We consistently deliver high-quality work.** All our products are rigorously tested before we deliver them to our clients. You’ll be required to help maintain our test suite and write new tests as you work on features. The full test suite must pass before you merge in your code.

**We sometimes work together.** Through the magic of the Internet, we sometimes will video conference via Zoom, or we might pair program for a while to work out a difficult problem. If you happen to live near Austin, Texas, then we might even get to work together in person sometimes.

**Learning on the Job.** We love learning and are never content with what we already know. As a company, we devote time and resources to learning and expanding our knowledge library. Openness to learning new things is essential. You’ll be expected and encouraged to build your skills and add to your personal toolbox. We encourage self-directed learning, but we may also want you to pursue some particular thread of knowledge for a particular project.
