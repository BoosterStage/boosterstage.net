Biola Universityâ€™s department of Associated Students asked us to help design a new website that visually reflected the character of the student body and allowed staff to easily add and update content.

Our solution consisted of a heavily customized version of Radiant CMS, which allowed staff to add pages and images, customize layouts, and moderate student-posted content.
