## All the good domains are taken

It's 2019, and all the good domains are taken.

Sure, you didn't expect your first choice to be available, but there must at least be _something_ suitable that isn't being held hostage by domain squatters for $15,000.

The most popular TLD (top-level domain) by far is ".com", accounting for over half of the 350 million or so domains in existence today. By some estimates, over 100,000 new domains are registered every day.

You're going to have to settle for some obscure made-up word or awful misspelling, right?

Not so fast! True, most of the desirable .com domains are already registered. But the good news is that it's still possible to come up with a pretty good domain for your new product or business. 

## Considerations when choosing a domain

As with any branding exercise, it's helpful to keep a few rules of thumb in
mind: 

### Branding

Like your name, your web domain one of the most important parts of your brand and identity. Your brand can communicate who you are, what you do, and who you serve.

### Brand Protection

Developing a strong brand involves taking steps to protect your brand from misuse by competitors. Registering your trademark is important, but so is securing alternate domain names. There's no rule that says you can't have multiple domains. In fact it may be wise to snatch up misspellings, alternate endings, DBAs (doing business as) and former names, and redirect those URLs to your main domain.

### Availability

While your exact, preferred ".com" domain may not be available, there are hundreds of new TLDs to choose from. You may not be able to get "paradisetravel.com", but you might land "paradise.travel". Just because the .com is taken doesn't mean you have to change your company name.

### Search

One of the most under-appreciated recent innovations in web browsers is the combination of the address bar with search. The modern web browser is smart enough to figure out if what you typed in the address bar was intended to be a web address or a search. Your web visitors no longer have to remember the exact URL for your website. They may be able to find your website simply by typing the name of your company in the address bar, and then clicking on the search results. Of course this means that SEO (search engine optimization) is more important than ever. Your site title, page descriptions, and web domain are all featured prominently in the search results, and it should be easy for searchers to pick out your site if they're looking for you by name.

## Domain horror

Ok, before we jump in to figuring out how to find a great domain, here are few cautionary tales.

It's pretty hard to screw up _too_ badly when procuring a domain. After all, the worst thing that can happen is that you end up not using the domain (unless you paid a premium for it, in which case more's the pity).

If you find a domain that might work, go ahead and pick it up if you can. Rare is the Internet entrepreneur who doesn't own a small stockpile of spare domain names, just in case.

Having said that, it's worth being a little careful before committing your brand and reputation to a domain, and especially before spending a small fortune on a premium domain.

### Country-specific domains

One of the most popular ways to find a good domain that matches your brand is to use a country-specific domain.

Domains ending in .es, .ly, are popular because they lend themselves to clever English word endings, like "clever.ly".

You'll probably recognize some of these companies:

*   bit.ly
*   donate.ly
*   embed.ly
*   musical.ly
*   intercom.io
*   draw.io

There are over 200 different country-specific domain extensions, and many are available for general registration. A few of the most popular TLDs:

*   .io (British Indian Ocean Territory)
*   .ly (Libya)
*   .ai (Anguilla)
*   .to (Tonga)
*   .it (Italy)
*   .es (Spain)
*   .is (Iceland)
*   .vc (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines)
*   .sh (St. Helena)

When building your company's brand on a country specific domain, it's important to keep in mind that your domain name may fall under the jurisdiction of that nation. Though it may seem unlikely, a lot of people were freaked out when [Libya siezed at one .ly domain without warning](https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/04/letter-ly-abrupt-ly-loses-domain-name-as-a-result-of-the-war-in-libya/).

It should go without saying that you probably shouldn't base your domain name in a nation that is officially designated as a "state sponsor of terrorism". Not very many registrars support TLDs for Iran (.ir), Syria (.sy), Sudan (.sd), or North Korea (.kp). Fortunately those are pretty crummy domain endings anyway, so it's not much of a loss.

### Made Up Words

You're in luck, Xobni.com is available! Xobni (pronounced zob-nee) was a company that made applications for Microsoft Office.

The problem with Xobni is... there are so many problems with Xobni. How do you spell it? How do you pronounce it? Imagine trying to explain that domain name to someone on the phone. Imagine trying to explain that domain to a non-technical person.

Here's a rule of thumb: don't make up a new word to fit available domains. It's not likely to work out very well.

### Dropped Vowels

Look, I know Internet companies are supposed to be hip, and trendy, and while we know that made-up words may not be so great, dropping vowels is just the way to identify with the kids these days.

Just look at Flickr, Mapstr, Lisnr, Plumbr, Quikr, and Callr. They can't all be wrong, right?

Well, first of all, [Flickr died years ago](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14192817) when Yahoo bought it and breathed death into it. So Flickr isn't exactly a good example of being trendy.

All these domains have the same problem as made-up words: how the heck are you going to explain this to your grandma. They might look pretty good on your logo, but it's going to end up being a problem in the long run.

The chances of someone typing "Plumber" into Google and coming up with your trendy "plumbr.com" domain are pretty slim, unless you spend a fortune on SEO and paid ads.

### Unintentionally Awkward

"Let's eat, Grandma" vs. "Let's eat Grandma".

Spacing and punctuation can make a big difference in meaning! Unfortunately domains have no spacing or punctuation, so multiple word domains just run together.

There are hundreds of examples of terrible branding failures—just search for "worst domain names". Here are a few of my favorites:

*   expertsexchange.com - Experts Exchange
*   penisland.net - Pen Island Pens
*   gotahoe.com – Go Tahoe
*   oddsextractor.com – Odds Extractor
*   auctionshit.com – Auctions Hit

You get the idea.

## How to Find a Great Domain

Now we get to the meat of it: how do we go about finding a great domain?

### Use an alternative TLD

Fortunately it’s 2019, and there’s no shortage of new top level domains

Gone are the days when people would be confused if your domain didn’t end in .com.

Though my dad still adds “.com” to every web address I give him, no matter how much I insist:

Me: Ok dad, go to mydomain.io
Dad: Ok I typed mydomain.io.com - it’s not coming up.
Me: SMH

Most popular domain extensions:

- .io
- .cc
- .co
- .me
- .ly

### Use Power Words

Power words spice up a sentence. People have been using power words to embellish
resumes since forever. Try combining

### Buck conventional wisdom

Conventional wisdom is that your domain should be as short as possible, without hyphens or special characters.

That probably isn't bad advice, but on the other hand, beggars can't be choosers.

Also, it's worth considering that increasingly, Internet users don't don't bother typing your domain - more than likely they'll just search for your company's name and click the link.

That being the case, there's an argument to be made that a longer domain might actually be better, if it matches your brand.

Most search engines display the domain name underneath the search results. If you had to choose between a badly spelled short domain versus a longer, descriptive domain with hyphens, choose the latter.

If your website is named "The Vietnamese Restaurant Directory", which of these seems easier to identify at a glance?

*   vnfooddir.com
*   vietnamese-restaurant-directory.com

### Pony Up

If you find a good domain that's for sale, and you've got the cash, it's probably worth it to swallow your pride and buy the domain at a premium.

## Legal Mumbo Jumbo

Finding a great domain is exciting. Keep in mind that it's not the end of your branding exercise.

If your domain name is confusingly similar to another product or service in your industry, you might want to reconsider. The last thing you want to hear when your company begins getting traction is "cease and desist".

If you're unsure about whether you'll run into copyright violations, it's not a bad idea to consult an attorney.

Speaking of which, if you're investing in your company's brand, you probably should consult an attorney anyway. They can help you do copyright and trademark searches, help you register your own trademarks, and generally help to keep you out of trouble.


## Get Creative

So there you have it: there's still an abundant supply of great web domains if
you're creative enough.
