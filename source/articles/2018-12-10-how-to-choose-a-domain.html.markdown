Branding a new product is hard, and finding a suitable domain is even harder. 

It's 2019, and all the good domains are gone. You're going to have to settle for some obscure misspelling. 


Domain squatters...

Non-competitive brands. 

Tips for finding a great domain.

# Use a popular alternative TLD
Fortunately it’s 2019, and there’s no shortage of new top level domains
Gone are the days when people would be confused if your domain didn’t end in .com. 
Though my dad still adds “.com” to every web address I give him, no matter how much I insist: 

Me: Ok dad, go to mydomain.me
Dad: Ok I typed mydomain.me.com - it’s not coming up. 
Me: SMH

Most popular domain extensions: 
- .io
- .cc
- .co
- .me
- .ly


# Considerations When Choosing a Domain
# Domain Horror

## Think carefully about country-specific domains. 

Domains ending in .es, .ly, are popular because they lend themselves to clever English word endings, like "clever.ly" 

When building your company's brand on a country specific domain, it's important to keep in mind that your domain name may fall under the jurisdiction of that nation. 

It should go without saying that you probably shouldn't base your domain name in a nation that is officially designated as a "state sponsor of terrorism". Fortunately not very many registrars support TLDs for Iran (.ir), Syria (.sy), Sudan (.sd), or North Korea (.kp). 




## You might want to avoid...
### .ly
A lot of people like the .ly domain because a lot of English words end in “ly”. 
There are two problems with this: 
- This is the TLD for Libya, which is a nation that sponsors terrorism. Big deal? Maybe, maybe not. Technically a despotic government could shut down your domain without warning; then what. 
- It can lead to some pretty awful intentional misspellings. For example:

- [https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/04/letter-ly-abrupt-ly-loses-domain-name-as-a-result-of-the-war-in-libya/]
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ly]

### .xxx
This goes without saying, unless you’re running a certain type of website. 

## Homographs

## Made Up Words
You're in luck, Xobni.com is available! Xobni (pronounced zob-nee) was a company that made applications for Microsoft Office. 


## Unintentionally Awkward
"Let's eat, Grandma" vs. "Let's eat Grandma". 

Spacing and punctuation can make a big difference in meaning! Unfortunately domains have no spacing or punctuation, so multiple word domains must run together.

* sydneytherapist.com - Sydney Therapist 
* gotahoe.com – Go Tahoe
* therapistfinder.com – Therapist Finder
* auctionshit.com – Auctions Hit

You get the idea.

# Legal Mumbo Jumbo
Finding a great domain is exciting. Keep in mind that it's not the end of your branding exercise. 
If your domain name is confusingly similar to another product or service in your industry, you might want to reconsider. The last thing you want to hear when your company begins getting traction is "cease and desist". 

If you're unsure about whether you'll run into copyright violations, it's not a bad idea to consult an attorney. 

Speaking of which, if you're investing in your company's brand, you probably should consult an attorney anyway. They can help you do copyright and trademark searches, help you register your own trademarks, and generally help to keep you out of trouble.
