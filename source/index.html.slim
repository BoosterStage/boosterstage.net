        p.has-text-centered.has-text-weight-bold Hi there! We build brand-new products for the web.

        markdown:

          Launching a new software product can be an epxensive and risky
          business. The last thing you want is to invest time and money into
          your precious product, just to have to go back to the drawing board.

          Trust us, that’s not the best way. Launching software doesn’t have to
          be risky.

          We take the risk out of launching brand new web-based SaaS (Software
          as a Service) apps. **Our goal is to help you get your first paying
          customers fast**. Because we believe that the best way to validate
          that you’re building the right product is to ask people to pay for it.

          Starting with our own Launchpad project scaffold, we can build and
          launch your web app in a matter of days, not months.

          Launching early makes a huge difference—you'll be able to test faster,
          make changes quicker, and get your first customers to validate your
          business model. From there the only way to go is up!

            Your project is built through a series of Sprints—periods of intense
            work, punctuated by review and learning. Each sprint results in a
            deliverable. Learning is applied to the next sprint.

            Your project will likely consist of many sprints. How many depends
            on the number and complexity of features.

            Sprints are almost always two weeks in length. We may break up
            more complex features into multiple week-long sprints. Two or more
            very simple features might be combined into a single sprint.

              enables us to skip building all the basic features that every app must
              have and get right to building your app's distinctive features.
