# Waiting for the product to be “finished” before marketing it.

# Letting the Great be the enemy of the Good

# Trying to satisfy too many customers

or ... Trying to serve too many segments
E.g. accountant users vs donors vs churches

# Building too big of a product

# Too sophisticated revenue model

E.g. credit card spread
Better: monthly fee, transactional fee.

# Too Much MVP

A lot of MVPs end up so big they don't really qualify as an MVP. Around here, a general rule is that an MVP should take a few weeks to develop; a couple of months max. Anything longer than that, and the _product_ goes out of the _minimum viable product_
Now, if that's your expectation, great. If you're launching a rocket into orbit, you're going to need significant investment and a lot of lead time. If you're developing a complex new product like an accounting tool, and you've got deep pockets and are ready to invest, we're not talking about you. You've got your ducks in a row and you know what you're doing (we hope).

# Delegating too much

As a manager, you have to delegate. It's how you accomplish big things.

> You need to be a user of the product you're building.

If you're not a direct user of the product we're building together, then you won't be able to fully understand the challenges that your users are experiencing.
