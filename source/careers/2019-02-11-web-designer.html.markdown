Launching software is hard. At Booster Stage, we’re on a mission to help businesses launch extraordinary software products. We believe market validation, agile methodology, and iterative development are keys to launching successful web-based products.

We have an immediate opening for a UI/UX design professional to help us build beautiful, easy to use web applications for our clients.

This is an hourly Independent Contractor position. We're looking for someone to help us with a few discrete projects on a regular basis, who we can call on more frequently as we grow.

If you’re a creative designer who is technically oriented, you’ll love this job. We’re bringing the most up-to-date tools and techniques to our clients. You’ll be up to your elbows in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Our product teams consist of a Project Manager, Web Developer, and Web Designer (that's you).

As UI/UX Web Designer you will:

- Design new interfaces for web applications.
- Redesign and refine existing interfaces to accommodate new features as they’re developed.
- Implement designs using HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript using Tailwind CSS.
- Assist the development team with creating interactive UI elements with
  JavaScript using the Stimulus framework.
- Communicate with the Project Manager to discover requirements and discuss implementation.
- Attend client meetings to develop a firm understanding of project
  requirements.

### Required Skills

- Extremely solid UI/UX design chops
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- Javascript
- Excellent written and spoken English
- Responsive design

### What we’d like to see in your portfolio

- Dashboard designs
- Before/after design refresh
- Brand-new UI mockups or wireframes

### Tools we use

- [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)
- [StimulusJS](https://stimulusjs.org)
- [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) ([Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) & [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#readme))
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## How we work

**You’ll be helping us build web apps for our clients**, most of which are startups or businesses launching new products. Most of the time we’re building the first version of their product. Sometimes we’re redesigning an existing product.

**You don’t need to be a coder**, but you do need to be able to find your way around a Ruby on Rails app. You’ll spend a fair amount of time time in Sketch or Photoshop, and you’ll also be implementing CSS and HTML in the web application environment. 

**This job is 100% remote**. Though you’re welcome to come in to work in our Elgin, TX office (near Austin), you’ll have ultimate flexibility over your own working schedule and environment.

**This is not a 9-5 job** (though it could be if those are your favorite hours). We rarely work over 40 hours per week, baring those rare moments of crunch time when we’re trying to hit a deadline or the server room is on fire.

Having said that, **you will be expected to attend client meetings (via Zoom)**, the majority of which occur during working hours in US time zones.

**We promote a distraction-free work environment**. Our work style is modeled after 37signals’ successful approach to productive remote work. We even use Basecamp as our primary communication tool.

**We write**. Because we don’t have the opportunity to chat over the water cooler, we write A LOT to keep each other in the loop. Basecamp is our water cooler, and we use the message board, Campfire, and check-ins extensively to keep each other up to date on what we're working on.

**You’ll also be encouraged to write for our company blog**. Three to six articles per year should just about do it, although we wouldn’t stop you from writing more frequently. Topics include MVP issues, product design, UI/UX, startup launch stories, and best/worst practices for startups. Writing for your personal blog is also A-OK.

**We sometimes work together**. Through the magic of the Internet, we sometimes will video conference via Zoom, or we might pair program for a while to work out a difficult problem. If you happen to live near Austin, Texas, then we might even get to work together in person sometimes.

**We learn on the job**. We love learning and are never content with what we already know. As a company, we devote time and resources to learning and expanding our knowledge library. Openness to learning new things is essential. You’ll be expected and encouraged to build your skills and add to your personal toolbox. We encourage self-directed learning, but we may also want you to pursue some particular thread of knowledge for a particular project.
