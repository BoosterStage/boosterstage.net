title: How to Make Software Like Pablo Picasso
subtitle: Who would have thought that a cubist's minimalism could teach us something about software design.
excerpt:  The question that the Critical Path designer asks is not “how much can we fit in to the first version and still hit our deadline”; it's “how little can we build and still make it work”.

I remember the first time I saw Pablo Picasso's “Bull” lithograph series. 

I was staying in Santiago, Chile, and there was a public exhibition of the
famous Cubist's work. Many of his amazing paintings, drawings,
sculptures, and lithographs were on display. 

Even though I enjoyed seeing all Picasso's work, there was one exhibit in particular
that made a lasting impression and has stuck with me all these years: the “Bull”
series of lithographs. 

What really struck me about the “Bull” series was that Picasso had seemed to work backwards. Starting with
a realistic sketch that any artist would have been proud of, he removed some
elements and abstracted others until all that was left was a simple line drawing. 

But even though it consisted of only seven or eight lines, the final drawing still
conveyed the impression of the bull. He had removed everything except that which
was absolutely essential to conveying the message of “this is a bull”. 

It was the opposite of everything I had learned about art up to that time. 

Art, I thought, was created by progressively adding to an image to make it
better, prettier, and more realistic. Picasso had turned this on its
head and showed me that art could also be created by _removing_ detail to reveal
the minimum amount of information that is required to convey an image. 

Pablo Picasso created “Bull” by progressively refactoring the image from a
realistic sketch into a completely abstract line drawing that, though it
lacks detail, still evokes the essence and form of a bull.

Like art, software development is not a linear process. [It is not like moving a
pile of stones](https://m.signalvnoise.com/running-in-circles-aae73d79ce19). If
it were, we could count the number of tasks to be done and multiply by how much
time each task takes and know exactly how long something will take to build. 

Instead, software development is more like drawing a sketch. A certain minimum
number of lines are required in order for an image to become recognizable. But
like Picasso, an experienced developer is able to abstract and reduce a feature
down to its essential simplicity by building only that which is absolutely
essential to the feature's functionality. 

Unlike Picasso, however, the software developer works in the opposite order: the bare
abstraction comes first, and layers of complexity are added after each feature is
tested and proven.

### Minimalism is not only for cubists

When creating software there is a strong temptation to build the whole package.
Every feature seems important, and it probably is.

But there's a problem: it's not humanly possible to create a complete software
project in one go-round. Without proper prioritization, the project becomes too
cumbersome, and the launch date becomes a receding deadline.

Throwing additional resources at a project doesn't help either. Any project
manager will tell you that doubling team size does not translate to halving the
timeline.

What we need is a reliable way to prioritize features. But without a strong
prioritization framework it's easy to get muddled in the details. That's where
the Critical Path comes in. 

### The Critical Path

A Critical Path is a list of the fewest number of features that have to be
built in order for the project to be considered a success. 

When you have a large list of things to do, a critical path helps to focus the
list on just those things that materially advance the goals of the project.
**The Critical Path does this while recognizing that other tasks are important also, and will be
done in due time.**

    All the points are important, but they can't all be done at once.

    essential to achieve early success.

The question that the Critical Path designer asks is not “how much can we fit in
to the first version and still hit our deadline”; it's “how little can we build
and still make it work”.

### Minimalism is Risk Mitigation

This minimalism isn't grounded in laziness. Instead it's a form of risk
mitigation. 

Writing software is inherently risky. Not “wingsuit base jumping into the open door of a flying airplane risky”, but risky.

</p>

Creating software is risky because it always involves using scarce resources, 
whether that's money or time, or both. Even if you're doing it yourself in your own spare
time, you're using time that you could have spent elsewhere. If your project
fails, you'll have wasted time. 

If there's money on the line, the risk is even greater. Nobody likes to waste
money. It's pretty much the worst feeling ever. (The only thing that's worse
than losing money is wasting more money due to the sunk cost fallacy.)

Focusing on the Critical Path&mdash;the *least* we must do&mdash;forces us to
think like Picasso. To trim out all the excess, and remove everything that
doesn't materially add to the actual delivery of our desired result.
