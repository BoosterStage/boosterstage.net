Launching software is hard. At Booster Stage, we’re on a mission to help businesses launch extraordinary software products. We believe market validation, agile methodology, and iterative development are keys to launching successful web-based products.

We have an immediate opening for a UI/UX design professional to help us build beautiful, easy to use web applications for our clients.

- Implement designs using HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript using Tailwind CSS.
- Communicate with our product managers and development teams to discover requirements and discuss implementation.
- Attend client meetings to hear the client describe their product first-hand.

Our product teams consist of a Product Manager, dedicated Developer, and UI/UX Product Designer (that's you).

- Excellent written and spoken English

- Before/after design refresh
- Brand-new UI mockups or wireframes

### Tools we use

- Ruby on Rails
- StimulusJS
- Webpacker & ES6
- Tailwind CSS

### How we work

**You’ll be helping us build web apps for our clients**, most of which are startups. Most of the time we’re building the first version of their product. Sometimes we’re redesigning an existing product.

**You don’t need to be a coder**, but you do need to be comfortable with code. You’ll certainly spend a lot of time in Sketch or Photoshop, but you’ll also be putting together CSS and HTML in the live web application environment.

**This job is 100% remote**. Though you’re welcome to come in to work in our Elgin, TX office (near Austin), you’ll have ultimate flexibility over your own working schedule and environment.

**This is not a 9-5 job** (though it could be if those are your favorite hours). We rarely work over 40 hours per week, baring those rare moments of crunch time when we’re trying to hit a deadline or the server room is on fire.

**We promote a distraction-free work environment**. Our work style is modeled after 37signals’ successful approach to productive remote work. We even use Basecamp as our primary communication tool.

**We write**. Because we don’t have the opportunity to chat over the water cooler, we write A LOT to keep each other in the loop. Basecamp is our water cooler, and we use the message board, Campfire, and check-ins extensively to keep each other up to date on what were working on.

**You’ll also be encouraged to write for our company blog**. Three to six articles per year should just about do it, although we wouldn’t stop you from writing more frequently. Topics include MVP issues, product design, UI/UX, startup launch stories, and best/worst practices for startups. Writing for your personal blog is also A-OK.

**We consistently deliver high-quality work**. All our products are rigorously tested before we deliver them to our clients. You’ll be required to help maintain our test suite and write new tests as you work on features. The full test suite must pass before you merge in your code.

**We sometimes work together**. Through the magic of the Internet, we sometimes will video conference via Zoom, or we might pair program for a while to work out a difficult problem. If you happen to live near Austin, Texas, then we might even get to work together in person sometimes.

**We learn on the job**. We love learning and are never content with what we already know. As a company, we devote time and resources to learning and expanding our knowledge library. Openness to learning new things is essential. You’ll be expected and encouraged to build your skills and add to your personal toolbox. We encourage self-directed learning, but we may also want you to pursue some particular thread of knowledge for a particular project.

### About Booster Stage

We build new products for the web.

Most of our work involves creating brand-new web apps for startups who are launching their MVP. Though we have also worked for big organizations who act like startups.

We’re a tiny family-owned business. Literally a mom and pop shop. Ryan and Bethany, the owners, have been building stuff for the web since 2004, and we’ve gotten really good at building new products for startups. Over the years we've created numerous websites and products for the web.

We blog on the [Booster Stage website](https://boosterstage.net/articles), and
we sometimes tweet what we're reading at
[@Booster_Stage](https://twitter.com/Booster_Stage). And when we're feeling
grown up we also hang out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/1292733/).
