CareGrove allows assisted living facilities to easily create and email invoices,
and accept payment via credit card.

We built CareGrove based on our Launchpad starter app. Using Launchpad, we were
able to quickly prototype the concept and release an alpha version, including
credit card processing, in just a few weeks.

### Resident Payments

Assisted living facility administrators are able to view each resident's payment
history at any time. Invoices are automatically created based on each resident's
payment agreement.

### Invoices

As invoices are paid, their status is updated in the CareGrove dashboard.
Residents and family members are able to make payments online using the payment
portal.

### Payments Report Dashboard

Real-time data displayed in the Payments dashboard helps facility administrators
keep on top of payments and invoices.

### Virtual Terminal

Residents and family members are able to pay their invoices by responding to the
invoice that they receive via email. In addition, facility administrators can
receive payments directly in the app via the virtual terminal.
