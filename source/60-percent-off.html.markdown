title: Take 60% off Your First Sprint

Are you a founder just getting your startup off the ground? Are you overwhelmed
with the options for building your first version? 

It's not easy to decide [how to build your
MVP](/articles/how-to-create-an-mvp/). 

There are dozens of development firms ready to help you, but how do you
decide which one? 

I'll give you the shortest answer I know: **choose the one that helps you
learn**. 

## What's wrong with product development? 

Conventional product development methodology works like this: 

1. You have an idea for a product. 
2. You tell your idea to the developer. 
3. Your developer builds your idea into a product. 
4. You launch your product.

Sounds great, right? Except for one thing. [Are you 100% sure that your
product idea solves a real problem for
someone?](/articles/the-three-questions-every-successful-product-must-answer/)
And are they willing to pay for it? 

I call this the "monolithic" approach to product development. 

Building a product before validating the business model is a trap that
almost every entrepreneur falls into at some point. I've done it myself.
It's so easy to see the value in your own solution; obviously someone out there
has the same problem, right? 

Maybe. Maybe you'll get lucky. But even so, there are other risks to
consider with the conventional "build-it-first" approach: 

- You might build features nobody wants. 
- You might build a feature that _almost_ does what customers want, but
  needs modification. 
- You might be missing features that seem obvious in retrospect. 

Each of these risks means that you'll have to go back to development to
correct the errors. It means more spending and more time, even after you
thought development was complete. So you built a feature nobody wants, or you
have to rebuild a feature. So what? How much did you spend on that feature? How
much will it cost now to get it right? 

And you only find that out _after_ the product is delivered. 

The monolithic approach requires you to define the scope of your product up
front. Developers will build what's in the scope, and then the product will be
delivered to you, "complete". 

This process, which almost every developer uses, leaves out a critical component of successful MVP development:
the **feedback loop**. 

Without that feedback loop we're developing in the dark. 

### Iterative Development: the **Sprint** model

That is why I advocate the **iterative** approach to product development.

The Iterative approach uses short, intense periods of work (usually two weeks), followed by a
rest. 

Each iteration is essentially a scientific experiment, designed to test a hypothesis. The
hypothesis might be: "this is the core feature of our app", or "users want to
solve this problem in this way". 

Each iteration results in running software. At the end of the iteration you'll
be able to use what we've created and present it to your test users. 

The rest between iterations is specifically designed to promote the learning feedback loop. 

### What about learning? 

**Learning** is simply the process of testing your product in the real
world with real users. Exactly how that works depends on your product: it
might be as simple as you and a handful of early adopters trying to complete
tasks and recording the feedback. 

What you learn during each iteration of your product development will inform
the next iteration. That means that we may decide to prioritize a certain
feature that may not have seemed obvious at first, or it might mean putting
other features on hold to focus on getting a certain function exactly right. 

### Reducing risk

All this results in reduced risk for you. 

Because we work in short sprints punctuated by rests designed for learning, you
are in control of the pace of your project. You can dial up or down the speed at
which we tackle sprints: you can push hard and fast, one sprint after another,
or you can take more time between sprints to validate your learning. 

It means we won't build features that your users don't need. That translates to
a more streamlined end product, more satisfied users, and reduced cost for you.
