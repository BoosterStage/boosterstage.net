              that is just waiting to have your features built into it. The scaffold
              enables us to skip building all the basic features that every app must
              have and get right to building your app's distinctive features.

            Your project is built through a series of Sprintsâ€”periods of intense 
            work, punctuated by review and learning. Each sprint results in a 
            deliverable. Learning is applied to the next sprint. 
            
            Your project will likely consist of many sprints. How many depends 
            on the number and complexity of features. 
        
            Sprints are almost always two weeks in length. We may break up
            more complex features into multiple week-long sprints. Two or more
            very simple features might be combined into a single sprint.
